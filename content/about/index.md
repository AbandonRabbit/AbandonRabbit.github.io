一个从体育生转型为全栈开发者的技术实践者。2018年，我以散打特长生的身份开始大学生涯，却在一次程序设计选修课后发现了对代码的热爱。从中专的VB入门，到专科主攻C#开发，再到本科系统学习计算机科学，我用5年时间完成了从体育生到开发者的蜕变。

技术之路上，我始终保持着运动员的拼搏精神。曾用2个月自学Go语言并成功入职开发岗位，参与游戏后台系统的研发；在蓝桥杯竞赛中获得省二等奖，证明了我的算法实力；开发的游戏后台管理系统将查询性能提升了40%。这些经历让我明白：优秀的开发者既要有扎实的技术功底，更要有解决问题的韧性。

除了代码，我还保持着写作的热情。校级征文比赛的一等奖让我懂得如何清晰表达技术思想，现在每周都会撰写技术博客复盘工作心得。从散打到编程，从写作到开发，这些看似不相关的经历塑造了我独特的优势——既能专注解决技术难题。


In 2018, I began my university journey as a Sanda (Chinese kickboxing) athlete. However, a serendipitous elective course in programming sparked a deep passion for code. From learning VB in vocational school, focusing on C# development in my associate degree, to systematically studying computer science at the undergraduate level, I spent five years transforming myself from a sports student into a developer.

On this path, I’ve carried with me the perseverance and drive of an athlete. I self-taught Go in just two months and secured a developer position, contributing to backend development for gaming systems. I won second prize in a provincial round of the Lanqiao Cup, demonstrating my algorithmic skills. I also optimized a game backend management system, improving query performance by 40%. These experiences taught me that to be an outstanding developer, one must not only possess strong technical fundamentals, but also the tenacity to solve complex problems.

Beyond coding, I have a deep love for writing. Winning first prize in a university essay contest taught me how to clearly articulate technical ideas. Today, I write weekly technical blogs to reflect on my work and growth. From martial arts to programming, from writing to development—these seemingly unrelated experiences have shaped my unique strength: the ability to focus deeply and solve tough technical challenges.
